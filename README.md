### 1. REST Endpoints

The system includes the following endpoints:

| Endpoint         | Method              | Description          |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| `/api/orders`    | GET/POST/DELETE/PUT | Manage orders.       |
| `/api/clients`   | GET/POST/DELETE/PUT | Manage clients.      |
| `/api/car-models`| GET/POST/DELETE     | Manage car models.   |
| `/api/car-parts` | GET/POST/DELETE     | Manage car parts.    |
| `/api/employees` | GET/POST/DELETE/PUT | Manage employees.    |


### 2. Services

Each feature has a dedicated service to handle business logic:

- **OrderService**: Implements logic for managing orders.
- **ClientService**: Handles operations for clients.
- **CarModelService**: Manages car models.
- **CarPartService**: Manages car parts inventory.
- **EmployeeService**: Manages employee data.


### 3. Repositories
Repositories are created for each entity, e.g., OrderRepository, ClientRepository. These interact with the database to perform CRUD operations.

### 4. Unit Tests
Unit tests ensure each REST endpoint and service operates as expected. **JUnit** framework was used for testing.

### 5. Database Persistence
The application uses a relational database (**MySql**) to store data. Entities include:

- **Order**: Represents a service order. Relations: Linked to Employee, Client and CarPart.
- **Client**: Represents client details. Relations: Linked to Order.
- **CarModel**: Represents car models. Relations: Linked to CarPart.
- **CarPart**: Represents car parts. Relations: Linked to CarModel and Order.
